Functional Programming With Friends
</h1>

FPWF is a small group of programmers that messes around with functional
programming and other ideas. It currently consists of:

* Curt Sampson <cjs@cynic.net>
* Nishant Rodrigues <nishantjr@gmail.com>
* Karthik Ravikanti <karthik.ravikanti@gmail.com>

### Current Research

We are currently working on:

* Using Scala in Android applications.
* Building a declarative, type-checked templating system that
  puts logic in 'data definition' templates, allowing multiple
  'view templates' to both use the common logic code and to be be
  checked against the data definition templates to ensure that
  they are not, e.g., leaving out fields.

FPWF is a small group of programmers that mess around with functional
programming and other ideas.


### People

### Current Research

We are currently contemplating:

* Using Scala in Android applications.
* Building an Android app that can automatically create forms that
  will fill in rows in Google Sheets. This could be used for tracking,
  e.g., time you spend working on projects, food you eat, etc.
* Building a declarative, type-checked templating system that
  puts logic in 'data definition' templates, allowing multiple
  'view templates' to both use the common logic code and to be be
  checked against the data definition templates to ensure that
  they are not, e.g., leaving out fields.
* Build an Antlr parser for PDF documents, generating an internal data
  structure for analysis, modification and rewriting.

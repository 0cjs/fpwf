FPWF is a small group of developers that mess around with mathematics,
functional programming and whatever else happens to distract us.

### Software and Projects

* [`git-commit-filetree`][gcf] - commit arbitrary files to an arbitrary
  git branch (used to build this site)

### Publications

* Our first blog entry: [{{site.posts.first.title}}]({{site.posts.first.url}})
* **[From Ruby to Haskell: An Introduction][r2ht]** (by Curt Sampson).<br/>
  A presentation/tutorial aimed at showing Ruby programmers some
  interesting and powerful elements of Haskell.

### Current Research

We are currently contemplating:

* Using Scala in Android applications.
* Building an Android app that can automatically create forms that
  will fill in rows in Google Sheets. This could be used for tracking,
  e.g., time you spend working on projects, food you eat, etc.
* Building a declarative, type-checked templating system that
  puts logic in 'data definition' templates, allowing multiple
  'view templates' to both use the common logic code and to be be
  checked against the data definition templates to ensure that
  they are not, e.g., leaving out fields.
* Build an Antlr parser for PDF documents, generating an internal data
  structure for analysis, modification and rewriting.
* Design a presentation or course that would take apart a language (Ruby
  is an obvious candidate) in to its bits, Ã  la CTM, comparing with other
  languages (e.g. Clojure for operator overloading, Java for typed vs.
  untyped, Prolog for logic, Haskell for most-common-control-structure,
  C++ for ???).

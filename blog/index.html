        <div class='post-excerpt'><p>Functional Programming With Friends started out as a few guys who wanted
to get together to play with some Haskell or whatever (much as most of
us had already done individually). But rather than just play, we thought
there might be a few projects toward which we could give a little stab,
and soon it sort of snowballed into making a blog, code available via
Github, and Lord Knows What Else. (Ok, yes, this is still a rather small
snowball.)</p>
